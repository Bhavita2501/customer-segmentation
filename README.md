# Marketing Analytics- Customer segmentation Project

This repository contains all the steps and analysis conducted on a dataset of transaction records. The aim is to unearth valuable insights, segment customers, and deploy predictive models for optimized marketing strategies.

## ðŸ“œ Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following fields:

- **InvoiceNo**: The unique identifier for each transaction.
- **StockCode**: Unique code for each product.
- **Description**: Product description.
- **Quantity**: The number of products in the transaction.
- **InvoiceDate**: Date of the transaction.
- **UnitPrice**: Price per unit of the product.
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Country**: The country where the customer resides.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Phases

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Addressed missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Ensured proper data types and standardized data formats.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Investigated the distribution of various features.
- Highlighted key trends and patterns.

### 3. Data Aggregation
- Summarized and grouped data for higher-level insights.

### 4. Data Visualization
- Utilized different chart types to visualize key patterns and insights.

### 5. Advanced Analysis
- Dug deeper into the data to find hidden patterns and correlations.

### 6. Feature Engineering
- Crafted new attributes derived from existing data to better inform our models and improve interpretability.

### 7. Customer Segmentation using Clustering
- Employed clustering algorithms like K-Means to break down the customer base into meaningful segments, allowing for more targeted marketing strategies.

### 8. Predictive Analysis
- Constructed predictive models to foresee future trends, behaviors, and customer actions.

### 9. Association Rule Mining
- Deployed algorithms like Apriori and FP-Growth to identify strong rule relationships between products, informing potential product bundles or marketing strategies.

### 10. Time Series Anomalies
- Analyzed transaction time series data to identify and investigate any irregularities or anomalies that could hint at underlying issues or events.

### 11. Product Recommendation System
- Implemented collaborative and content-based filtering methods to generate product recommendations for customers, enhancing their shopping experience.

### 12. Churn Prediction
- Developed predictive models to estimate the likelihood of a customer leaving or ceasing to purchase, helping to inform retention strategies.

### 13. Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Optimization
- Adjusted and refined model parameters to enhance performance, leveraging techniques like GridSearch and RandomizedSearch for optimal results.
